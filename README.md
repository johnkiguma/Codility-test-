Initialize balance to 0
Initialize monthly_fee to 0
#Extract date and amount from the expense
 #   If amount < 0:
  #      Add amount to balance (expense)
  # Extract month from the date
#  If month is January:
 #       Set monthly_fee to 5
    
  #  If date ends with '-01':
   #     Deduct monthly_fee from balance
    #    Reset monthly_fee to 0

#Calculate total_spent as the sum of amounts in expenses
#Calculate remaining_balance after deducting the annual fee (12 * 5)

#Print "Total spent: total_spent"
#Print "Remaining balance after deduction: remaining_balance"
